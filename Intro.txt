 how to create a banking application that uses conditions and locks to ensure thread safety, practice designing programs that take advantage of multiple threads without losing data integrity, and learn how to apply multithreading to your own projects. By the end of the guided project, you will be able to create your own thread-safe Java multithreaded applications.

Mutithreading is an essential part of modern programming. Almost all modern computers contain multi-core CPUs, GPUs, or even multiple CPUs. Multithreading allows us to have multiple parallel threads of execution, allowing our programs to become multiple times faster than a single threaded application. In addition, understanding parallel programming principles is essential for building many modern applications such as video games, data science, and server connections. Understanding how to create Java multithreaded applications will greatly expand your programming potential.
